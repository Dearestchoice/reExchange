**Purpose of the Contract:**
The PaymentGateway contract is designed to enable merchants to receive payments in ERC20 tokens (USDT, USDC) and dynamically manage fees based on real-time conditions using Chainlink automation (Keepers). It also integrates Chainlink price feeds to convert crypto payments into their fiat equivalents. The contract implements mechanisms to confirm payments, generate payment links, and notify users of missed payments, while leveraging automation to adjust fee rates dynamically.

**Events**:
These are events emitted during specific actions:
   - TokenAdded: This event tracks the addition of a new token, emitting the token's address and its price feed address.
   - PaymentReceived: Logs payment information.
   - PaymentLinkGenerated: Logs a new payment link.
   - FeePercentageUpdated: Logs changes in the fee percentage.
   - PaymentConfirmed: Logs confirmation of payments.
   - MissedPaymentNotification: Logs notifications for missed payments.

**Functions:**  
- Payment Function: Allows customers to pay in ERC20 tokens and prevents reentrancy with nonReentrant.
- Fiat Conversion: Fetches the latest price data from Chainlink, checks that the price is valid, and converts the crypto amount into its fiat equivalent using the price.
- Payment Link Generation: Generates a payment link with the amount and currency, then emits an event. Only the owner (merchant) can call this function.
- Fee Management: Allows the owner to update the fee percentage, with a maximum limit of 10%.
- Chainlink Keepers Automation: 
    - Chainlink Keepersâ€™ checkUpkeep checks if the fee needs to be updated based on the time interval.
    - performUpkeep is triggered by Chainlink Keepers to adjust the fee percentage periodically, lowering it by 0.5% each time the interval is exceeded.
- addSupportedToken: This function allows the contract owner to add support for new ERC20 tokens to the payment gateway, along with the corresponding Chainlink price feed and an initial fee percentage. This is crucial for the dynamic handling of multiple tokens within the payment system.
- calculateDynamicFee: This is a helper function used to dynamically calculate the transaction fee based on the current price of the token. This provides a reactive mechanism to adjust fees in response to token price changes.
- Callback and Notification:
   - Used to confirm payments, ensuring that a payment can only be confirmed once.
   - Notifies the customer if they missed a payment or made an underpayment.
- Utility Functions: Utility functions to convert addresses and numbers into string format for generating payment links.

# Overall Contract Summary:
   - Payment Gateway: The contract serves as a reactive payment gateway allowing payments in supported ERC20 tokens, with dynamic fee calculation and Chainlink price feed integration.
   - Multiple Tokens: It supports adding multiple ERC20 tokens, each with its own fee and price feed.
   - Dynamic Fee System: The contract adjusts fees automatically based on token price data from Chainlink, ensuring that high-price tokens carry lower fees and low-price tokens carry higher fees.
   - Automation: Chainlink Keepers are used to automate certain contract actions, such as updating the fee based on a time interval.

**Key Features:**
- Multiple Token Support: Merchants can add multiple ERC20 tokens to the gateway. For each supported token, the contract links a Chainlink price feed to retrieve up-to-date pricing.
Tokens are stored in the supportedTokens mapping, ensuring each token has an associated price feed and fee structure.

- Dynamic Fee Calculation: The contract adjusts transaction fees based on the token's current price, allowing for higher fees for lower-priced tokens and lower fees for higher-priced tokens.
The calculateDynamicFee function encapsulates the logic for fee adjustments, making the fee system market-responsive.

- Chainlink Price Feeds: The contract uses Chainlink oracles to fetch real-time pricing for tokens. This allows the contract to price token transactions in terms of a stable fiat equivalent (e.g., USD), providing more stability for merchants accepting payments.

- Chainlink Automation (Keepers): The contract automatically updates token fee structures periodically (e.g., daily) using Chainlink Keepers, ensuring that fees stay up-to-date with market conditions without manual intervention from the owner.

- Owner Control: The contract owner (merchant) can add supported tokens, set initial fee percentages, and manage price feed addresses.
Only the owner can perform administrative functions like adding tokens or withdrawing collected fees, ensuring secure control over the payment system.

- Payment Processing: The contract processes payments in supported tokens by calculating the required token amount based on the current price from Chainlink oracles.
It ensures that each payment adheres to the dynamically calculated fee, making it fair for users in different market conditions.

- Events: Several events, such as TokenAdded and FeeUpdated, are emitted during key contract operations, enabling transparency and traceability of important actions in the system.

- Flexible Fee Adjustment Logic: The calculateDynamicFee function is designed to be modifiable, allowing developers to fine-tune how fees are calculated depending on specific use cases or market needs.

- Security: The contract is designed with basic security measures such as the onlyOwner modifier to ensure that sensitive operations are restricted to the contract owner.
